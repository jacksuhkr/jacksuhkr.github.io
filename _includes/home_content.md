# About me
My name is Jaewook J. Suh.  
I'm a Ph.D. student in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University.  
I study optimization, and my advisor is [Ernest K. Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/).


# Current Research Interest
I am now interested in **continuous-time analysis** for accelerated methods in optimization theory.
I recently suggested a novel framework called **dilated-coordinate system**, in the paper [*Continuous-Time Analysis of AGM via Conservation Laws in Dilated Coordinate Systems*](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/suh22a.html).
Seems it was interesting to other people as well, it is accepeted in ICML 2022 with long presentation :)  

I am now working on extending this framework to other settings!
